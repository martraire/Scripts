    This repository contains various scripts to launch Batch jobs or to 
    run some algorithms on distributed computing (PCfarm/Grid computing).
    These scripts are mainly Shell (bash, tcsh) but there are some Perl.



    1- Batch jobs

    Most of these scripts are for Batch jobs. Here is the details :

        - job.sh : Script to ...

                   D



    2- Distributed Computing

    Here is the script to run my software on Grid computing :

        - SnakeGame: Fixe 
                     F
